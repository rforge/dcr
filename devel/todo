## *** dclone ***
## Basic infrastructure for DC and stable parallel implementations.
* OK -- add parallel RNG to snowWrapper
* OK -- add parallel RNG option
* OK -- rework options as dcoptions() similar to pboptions
* OK -- documentation should reflect options
* OK -- update references (dclone-package, etc.)
* OK -- check fun for inits on remote workers: examples added
* OK -- dc.fit: fails when unable to calculate dctable or dcdiag
  easiest way is to shut it down by an option (arg is not nice)
  try() is used to turn these into NA
* OK -- reduce jags.parfit initialization overhead by seeding inits only
  rjags addition will resolve this by M Plummer -- needs fullow up                      !!!
* add NEWS/NEWS.Rd from 1.3-0 on (maybe only to www?)
* deprecate as.mcmc.list.bugs if possible
* error witb WinBUGS (registry is wrong in bugs.update.settings)                        !!!

## *** dcmle ***
## S4 classes for examples and to estimating procedures
* OK -- dcmle released to CRAN
* OK -- classic BUGS examples in www/examples (former dcexamples)
* OK -- dclone-ification started

## *** dctutor ***
## Tutorial for dclone and related packages.
* add general install tutorial (only JAGS?)
* OK -- add examples from www and develop function to retrieve those (dcmle)
* OK -- currently in www/tutorials

## *** dctests ***
## Package for testing dontrun examples in dclone and related packages.
now in devel dir, can run batch mode
* OK -- dclone dontrun examples
* OK -- dcmle dontrun examples
* OK -- dcexamples test suite
* dcextras examples
* dctutor examples

## *** dcextras ***
## New package for not fully supprted and developmental stuff.
* OK -- bugs.parfit: add to repo with enhanced examples
* OK -- pairs method for mcmc.list --> went to dclone
* OK -- STAN support (parallel with snow and forking)

## *** dcglm ***
## Obsolete, now part of www/tutorials
* None

## dependent packages
* OK -- add progress bar to functions
* OK -- implement dcmle to sharx
* implement dcmle to detect
* implement dcmle to ResourceSelection
* add verbose text to function

    * Complete rework of the package internals, no user visible
      changes (except for coda type methods are now available
      without extra as.mcmc.list coercion, including plots).
    * dcmle class replaces dcMle, new classes and methods added.

Version 0.1-6, March 22, 2012
    * dcmle: cl=1 is now acceptable (defaults to NULL).
      Note that this behaviour is different from that is in dclone.

Version 0.1-5, Feb 25, 2012
    * S4 methods compliance for R 2.15.0:
      importFrom(stats4, coef, confint, summary, vcov)
      added to namespace (reported by B Ripley).

Version 0.1-4, Jan 31, 2012
    * sourceDcExample: topic is coerced to character.
    * Documentation updated.
    * NAMESPACE updated to export all classes,
      and import new functions from dclone.
    * S4 summary method is now imported from stats4 and not
      redefined again.

Version 0.1-3, Jan 25, 2012
    * Preparing for new release.

Version 0.1-2, Oct 18, 2011
    * params slot can be list (to follow new dclone options).
    * show/summary method for dcMle class got headings:
      Settings, Coefficients, Convergence.
    * dcmle failed with initsfun when length(n.clones)==1
      and n.clones>1: now fixed.
    * dcmle checks for getOption("mc.cores") and uses it
      when cl=NULL and mc.cores > 1. This allows
      forking to happen automatically via the global option.

dclone package version history

Version 1.3-3, May 13, 2011
    * *.parfit: write model to hard drive only if
      cluster type is SOCK (shared memoty)
    * snowWrapper: dir=NULL is set as the default.
    * mcmcapply functions simplified, FUN can be missing.
    * jags.parfit help notes that there is no update method
      for parallel mcmc.list objects.
    * snowWrapper got cleanup=TRUE argument to remove
      data after evaluating main function.

Version 1.3-2, March 2, 2011
    * Partial argument match fixed (NOTE from R CMD CHECK).
    * write.jags.model got new argument overwrite=FALSE.
    * Typo in rng.type argument of snowWrapper fixed.
    * plotClusterSize: col arg is reordered according to
      balancing type.

Version 1.3-1, January 4, 2011
    * JASA paper (Lele et al. 2010) citation added to Rd.
    * loading rjags changed: it is now only suggested.
      Reason: some dclone functionality might be useful
      without JAGS/rjags present, and now loading
      rjags won't cause error if JAGS shared library
      not found.
    * glm module not loading at startup because
      it cannot be nicely unloaded in parallel versions.
    * dcoptions RNG got "none" value as default,
      *.parfit functions use dcoptions for snowWrapper.
      As a result, dependencies changed a bit.
    * dc.parfit: none/both balancing fixed (were switched).

Version 1.3-0, December 31, 2010
    * preparing for major CRAN release.
    * final RJ citation added.

Version 1.2-3, December 16, 2010
    * bugs.parfit: migrated into the new dcextras package
      where experimental and not fully supported functions
      will reside in the future.

Version 1.2-2, October 21, 2010
    * expanded examples for *.parfit functions.
    * clusterSeed removed from package: use
      clusterSetupRNG in snow instead.

Version 1.2-1, August 26, 2010
    * experimenting with bugs.parfit:
      the different seeds approach is not satisfactory
      because it cannot garantee independence of the chains
    * seed arg added to bugs.fit
    * RNG option added to work with snowWrapper
    * set.rng arg added to snowWrapper that calls
      snow::clusterSetupRNG
    * options for dclone reworked: can be accessed via
      the dcoptions function, and it sets the dcoptions option
    * dclone.dcdim: dimnames bug fixed when drop=TRUE
    * examples added on inits specifications for *.parfit

Version 1.2-0, August 26, 2010
    * polishing plot methods for R Journal paper.
    * citation entry added.

Version 1.1-1, May 6, 2010
    * print.custommodel has deparse=FALSE argument.
    * glm module for JAGS >2.0 is loaded at startup
    * parallel RNG handling reworked.
    * dctable fix for one parameter mcmc.list.
    * dcdiag returns r.hat for one parameter models.

Version 1.1-0, May 3, 2010
    * dclone was tested with JAGS 2.0.
    * major release submitted to CRAN.

Version 1.0-7, April 7, 2010
    * added flavour argument in dc.parfit.
    * methods for mcmc objects added (coef, vcov, quantile).
    * plot.dcdiag got log.lambda.max option.
    * log.var type of plot.dctable changed.

Version 1.0-6, March 14, 2010
    * openbugs.seed removed.
    * bugs.fit fixed, several arguments removed.
    * dcpar package merged with dclone.
    * WinBUGS/OpenBUGS related revision done:
      as.mcmc.list.bugs and dc.fit now works properly.
    * dclone.ts removed, use dcdim instead.

Version 1.0-5, January 25, 2010
    * drop and perm arguments in dcdim.

Version 1.0-4, January 14, 2010
    * nclones.list: returns 'method' attributes.
    * vcov: got invfisher argument.
    * S3 methods added for diagnostic functions.
    * dclone options restructured.
    * dclone and dcpar split: parallet computing features
      in separate package.
    * dcdiag: diagnostic tools for data cloning.
    * chisq.diag: diagnostic tool added.

Version 1.0-3, December 14, 2009
    * lambdamax.diag: added back.
    * errlines: got col argument.
    * jags.fit: if n.iter=0, the (updated) JAGS model is returned
      instead of an MCMC object.
    * update.mcmc.list: function to perform automatic updates of an
      MCMC object, until a desired statistics value 
      (e.g. R_hat < 1.1) reached.

Version 1.0-2, December 4, 2009
    * updated.model attr in jags.fit output for further updating.
    * bg arg in errlines and box.bg in plot.dctable for background
      color of boxes.

Version 1.0-1, November 19, 2009
    * custommodel function added, fitting functions modified.

Version 1.0-0, November 16, 2009
    * Unload problem fixed (reported by Brian D Ripley).
    * dctable now can take more than one models as arguments.
    * Code annotated, documentation revised.

Version 0.9-0, October 19, 2009
    * First CRAN release with basic functionality.
    * Support for WinBUGS added.
    * Initial functionality is stable.
